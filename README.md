# Noita-Worldpixelscenes-Visualizer
 
## Description
Visualizes a file in the save files of the game: https://noitagame.com/
It was made when the community was still figuring everything out the game had to offer.
This application found out there was a moon.
It is a simple and small program but it shows that I can make good use of comments and can handle errors.
